# Work Day Scheduler
Description
    For this project, I was tasked with creating a daily scheduler that allowed the user to save events by the hour and used a color code system to indicate whether events have passed (past-light grey), are currently happening (present-red), or will happen (future-green). Using third-party APIs like Bootstrap and jQuery, I built a functional calendar that used the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
